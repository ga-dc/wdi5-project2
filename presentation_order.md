# Project 2 Presentations

30 minutes per group:
- No more than... 5 minutes setup
- No more than... 20 minutes presentation
- 5 minutes Q&A

"No more than" means that's an upper *limit*! Your audience will probably be grateful if you stay below that limit.

Reminder: We'll be expecting each team member to speak substantially.

Representatives from USA Today will be joining us.

We're **SO EXCITED** to see what you've built -- and so impressed by what we've seen already!
